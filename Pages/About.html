		<h1>About</h1>
			<article class="about">
				A talented barber with over a decade's worth of experience.<br>
				Doing undercuts, styling, long hair or short, but specializing in fades.<br>
				Starting out in Philadelphia, he has done hair and traveled across the east coast, and finally chosen to settle down in the mid-west.<br><br>
				Outside of barbering he does construction, web-design, and even minor mechanics.<br>
				After 4 years of apprenticeship he's a Journeyman in a local union of St. Louis.<br>
				A short 6 month sprint with LaunchCode101 set up his knowledge-base to include JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. during which he was able to make this web-site! <br><br>
				In the long-term he hopes to have multiple avenues of income, from being a developer, a master barber, a JourneyMan Construction worker, dabbling in stocks and trades, and even real estate.
				There's nothing that's going to stop him.<br><br>
				But ultimately it's the look on his clients face when they're instilled with new-found confidence and joy from looking in the mirror and seeing a side of themselves that they didn't know existed, and truly falling in-love with themselves that keeps him cutting hair.
